# From-scratch CentOS 6.5 Docker image

As-minimal-as-possible CentOS 6.5 image using `febootstrap`.  The idea of
checking in a large, opaque binary file makes me itch, but the Docker model
doesn't currently allow for more control over image creation.  This is hopefully
the only time I'll have to do thisâ€¦

Modeled after [docker-brew-ubuntu](https://github.com/tianon/docker-brew-ubuntu).

## generating filesystem image
